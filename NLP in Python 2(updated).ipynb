      "['IntroFade the music out. Let’s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all.', '“The Old Lady And The Dog”I live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!', '“My Daughter Likes Fish”You ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”', '“The Food Chain”Must be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.', '“Courtyard Confrontation”I live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.', '“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”I’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”', '“Putting On Socks”The worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.', '“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”I don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.', '“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”I like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.', '“Everybody Has Their Time”Everybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”']\n"

       "['[cheers and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you. [cheers and applause]',\n",

Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road.

       " '“The Old Lady And The Dog”I live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!',\n",
       " '“My Daughter Likes Fish”You ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”',\n",
       " '“The Food Chain”Must be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.',\n",
       " '“Courtyard Confrontation”I live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.',\n",
       " '“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”I’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”',\n",
       " '“Putting On Socks”The worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.',\n",
       " '“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”I don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.',\n",
       " '“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”I like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.',\n",

People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”',\n",
       " '“Dating Takes Courage”It’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”',\n",
       " '“First Date”I always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.',\n",
       " '“Tits”Guys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!”',\n",

I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.',\n",

Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!”',\n",

If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal?

       " '“Behind The Wheel”It’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.',\n",
       " '“If Murder Was Legal”A lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.',\n",

It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of coursechildren who have nut allergiesneed to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’refighting for your countryand you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of courseslaveryis the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.',\n",

       "\"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage:Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of theirmetabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautifulinner thigh clearancewhere they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t haveinsomniayet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t haveHPVyet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into aself-help library. I’m not interested in books likeFifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!I have ahoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.The last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of aTexas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I alsogot married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… twohomeless peopleinside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They gotno body hairfrom the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men,no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re bothhalf-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are bighippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonnapropose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write forFresh Off the Boaton ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gottashit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-lawhad this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a–I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seekinganal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover theirprostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him tospankme, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wroteLean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word“bossy”in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like,become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I amseven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well,Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely.My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh,I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s,I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot.You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had amiscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, veryscared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazydouble standardin our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

       "'   ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage mr jim jefferies  hello sit down sit down sit down sit down sit down  thank you boston i appreciate that  uh thats very sweet of you  love you im at the end of the tour right now im very happy to be on tour because i now have a child ah so any time out of home is good for me um i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months so  thank you thank you life decisions and shes a nice girl and i love her in a way sure my problem with my girlfriend is shes very sweet but shes shit at telling stories and im awesome at telling stories so it really bothers me when she talks and i dont know if thatll be a problem in the future but its a problem now and i dont see it getting better um ill give you an example right i was in the car and my son hank was asleep in the back seat and were driving along and on the radio comes madonna and my girlfriend just slips into conversation oh i used topartywith madonna and i went you fucking what when and she went i used to party with madonna now i should fill you in a little bit on this my girlfriend used to be a model in miami right im not bragging i didnt get the model years i didnt get those years ive seen the photos very impressive um so i said so you used to party with madonna madonna used to have big parties and invite models over right and she went no no it would just be me and a few other people i go you need to elaborate on this story right now and she goes oh okay i used to date the center for the miami heat as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center even if this guys even slightly in proportion a lot of things flood through your head first thing is thats why your cunts so fucked up thats a big one thats why our child came out while you were walking i understand so she said i used to date the center for the miami heat his best friend was dennis rodman dennis rodman used to go out with madonna and we used to go over to madonnas house and she goes this one time the four of us were over at madonnas house and we were all fucked up on drugs and one thing led to another and then i went shut the fuck up and she went what i said i know what one thing led to another means you all started fucking each other and she went we did we started just shut up and she goes what do you care for i said youre the mother of my child i dont wanna picture you being fucked by a  nba player while youre licking out madonnas muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock going  and she goes oh youre being silly what do you care for youve partied way more than i have in my life and i went that is not true ive gotten wasted way more than you have but i have in no way partied way more than you have often i get wasted just by myself i wouldnt call it a party for most of my career i was a struggling comedian right and this is how struggling comedians party right its  am monday right were in a onebedroom apartment seven of us are standing around a coffee table trying to stretch out two grams of coke one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories and the rest of us are talking about where women might be one of us has come up with a plan the plan goes like this well nurses will be finishing their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er theyll appreciate seven funny guys  i dont you know ive never partied like a model i have partied twice in my life twice like really partied ive had good nights out but ive really partied twice if you really party and most people never experience this its an amazing thing it happens in vegas it can only happen in vegas and its gotta involve celebrity right im not famous but the people around me were super famous and i was at this party in the night club and they took me in and then theres the night club but then theres the real night club out the back which is like the size of this stage its only a little room and you go back there and you can just they encourage you to take drugs in the open and youre just doing it off a key  and theyre going no dude use the table dont use your and i go oh oh oh sorry um and its confusing at first and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room just bring em in like huh and you can do this you can go uh like that and theyll drag these women away it is the best thing youll ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man theres a lot of remorse cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friends you go oh my god we partied so hard last night i spent  when a hot girl parties that hard she wakes up in the morning and goes oh my god we partied so hard last night i made  and thats a vastly different emotion that i dont think women will never yeah okay this is the thing in america at the moment theyre trying to raise theminimum wageto i dont know  an hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go and still to this day women only earn  of what men earn in the workplace and of course thats disgusting how dare women earn so much like a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i dont actually mean but this is something im really passionate about women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace im sorry i  im not being a misogynistic bastard right im not saying that women dont work as hard im sure they do im not saying they dont do as good a job what im saying is they dont deserve to earn as much money as men right men need that extra  to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit  now im sure theres women in this room that are saying oh i pay for my drinks i bought my own ticket and dont think we dont appreciate the uglies cause we do right we do but theres little things in society that you cant change men have extra expenses that youll never understand theres holidays that are just for women likevalentines dayis just for women they say its for romantics they say its for couples or something like that its just for women theres no man who gets excited by valentines day theres no man that when he sees the valentines day decorations go up in the shopping mall he goes oh valentines day is coming valentines day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head and it goes like this how much money do i have to spend today so that you wont act like a cunt it doesnt stop theremothers day mothers day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old my girlfriends first mothers day and she went oh i wonder what ill get for mothers day and i went probably fucking nothing hes got no money hes six months old what do you think hes gonna buy you within an hour her friends were over at the house just by coincidence telling me what a bad person i was and how important mothers day is to a new mum you know and so i went and bought her a cappuccino machine cause i assumed thats what hank would have wanted her to have and i wrote a card im not a bastard i wrote a card im righthanded so i got my left hand every new dad knows this you get the crayon and you go  happy mothers day love hank and i went han and then i did the k backtofront because hes a fucking moron see now i know theres people in the room theyre thinking well fathers havefathers day fathers day is bullshit its fucking shit fathers day fathers day came around and my girlfriend went what do you want for fathers day and i went i dont want anything dont even worry about it i dont want anything and she goes come on you gotta have something i said honestly i dont want anything and she goes come on and i went its my fucking money just dont touch it just leave my money alone how hard is this how about for  hours you dont touch my fucking money that would be a gift thats why every single father has that one fathers day gift that they cherish and its shit its like a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handles too big and it says i heart dad and they keep that for  fucking years this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go that cost me nothing that mug  see wouldnt it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff but didnt cost anything that everyone could participate in right ive got it right april anal sex day  its good isnt it everyones girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april  its nice a month before youd be walking around the shopping center going oh the decorations are up  and its good cause if your bird didnt take it in the ass you could do the same thing that women do on valentines day when they dont get a gift you could go like oh me mate jason his wife took it in the ass twice yeah obviously theyre more connected than we are theyve uh im thinking i dont do much merchandise after my shows and stuff but im thinking of bringing out some april  tshirts not even putting jim jefferies on them or anything just tshirts that say april  cause its good right youre in a bar youre a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april  and you go fucking friends for life right but even better you see a girl with an april  tshirt the weird thing is im biggingupanal sexhere and i dont even really like fucking girls in the ass that much im not even a huge fan i much prefer the cunt i think its a much more i think that a cunt is a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex oh you know i do it i get involved cause i feel like i have to you know i but ive never been a big fan of the ass fucking i uh when i watch it on porn it seems very inviting the girls taking it so fluently in her ass and she seems to be having fun and uh but the thing is you cant smell porn you dont smell porn you just you just watch it they never and its different porn its different they clean the girls asshole they pump water into it until its very hygienic im sure and the girl seems to be so happy shes like youve got it in her pussy youre fucking her and then shes like put it in my ass shes inviting its like youre doing her a favor in porn and then shes like she says things i dont know things like im enjoying that keep putting it in my ass fuck my ass i love a cock in my ass and and the experience ive had in my own life has been vastly different ive my experience has been a lot of crying now although that can help you come at times its not what you want its not what you want for every day i like the girl who acts like shes enjoying it like you know when your girlfriends like im gonna act like i enjoy it she does that whole yeah oh no thats good  ahh  im having a good time  and then theyre always going are you done are you close to done you never fuck a pussy and they go are you almost done finish this like that if youre fucking ass they dont want you they want it all over quick and they do other things the porn girls i dont know how much they get paid im sure its more than what the men get paid its the opposite bit of society um but they do a thing called atm i dont know if you know what that is kids that stands for ass to mouth thats where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus and shell put it directly in her mouth and shell say something like i love the taste of my ass let me taste my ass and then the man as a favor to this woman puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work  shes been doing now i had a drunken night with my exgirlfriend where she thought shed be all wild and try that once again vastly different experience im not a big fan of the ass fucking and i dont know of any man if theyre truthful really is now theres women in the room who are thinking well why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass  what a good question  women the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because we know you fucking hate it  so im a father umi love my soni love my son the same way that i love cigarettes i like to hold him for five minutes every hour and the rest of the time im thinking about how hes fucking killing me hes a good little boy no hes a great little fella i really like him um my girlfriend super loves him though its fucking creepy and im glad i have a son that worked out good for me i wouldnt be a good father to a girl it wouldnt be good for me nothing weird wouldnt fuck it i i just dont get along with women you know how it is i dont want them in my house and so because you dream see for example okay when hank was born the couple over the road within two weeks of hank being born had a baby girl and rightly or wrongly the first thing that went through my head was aw thats great i hope hank fucks that one day thats what i think cause thats what i think about my son i hope when hes of age he just fucks everything i dont care if my son is gay or straight all i care about is when he is of age that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires that is my dream for my son  but never in the history of fathers and daughters has a father held his baby girl and gone oh i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life i hope youre never shy of a cock i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up right you know and its not just me women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning i go there very occasionally and when you go to the gym theres a little daycare crche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off and inside that daycare theres like three women in their  theyre very nice ladies and you hand your kid off and he plays then when you finish your workout you come and get him and theres a woman that works there who just loves my son she sees all the other kids but she loves hank and hank fucking loves her and the two of them light up when they see each other and its super cute i bring hank up the stairs and he starts going uh uh trying to reach at her all right and she does this she goes everyone my boyfriends here heres my boyfriend give him here hes my boyfriend and then she kisses him and she goes  my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses  its fucking adorable but i tried doing that with a baby girl lets say you go to the gym and theres a daycare and me and a couple of my mates are working there hey everyone me girlfriends here give her here give her here shes my girlfriend my girlfriend gives me kisses you know that right shes always giving me kisses enjoy your workout dont worry about a thing   so also its just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter its just little things even when theyre babies its just easier theres a wiping technique when youre wiping a babys ass i dont know if you have children but this is how you do it the baby lays on its back you put their feet together you lift the feet up and then you go in and wipe with a boy you can wipe like that up and down side to side whatever the fuck you want right with a girl you gotta wipe downward and away downward and away its very important that you wipe away from the cunt very important cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts they do they fucking hate it boys dont give a shit fucking my son will have shit all over his dick and balls and ill be cleaning it off under the foreskin and hell be laughing like its the best day ever even at my age now i find it funny if i have shit on my dick if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass i pull out ive got shit on my dick ill ring me mate jason up and go hey jason its happened again i got shit on my dick and hell tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick and well laugh and laugh and laugh but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and shes thought oh i cant wait to call karen   when you when my girlfriend got pregnant when you meet when you havent got a child couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children whenever you meet couples with children theyre always like it is the most fulfilling thing ive ever done with my life my heart grows larger and larger every day and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant those same people went like this youre never gonna sleep again  forget about it its over youre not gonna sleep theyre constantly telling you youre not gonna sleep raising a baby is not that hard ill tell you what its easier than a coke habit i had a coke habit for sevenandahalf fucking years at least its not me who wakes up crying anymore i can sleep through other people crying ive had girlfriends thats like white noise to me i find it soothing see me and my girlfriend just two months we went fuck it lets have a kid fucking did it right these other people man you know these couples and they date from high school and then they go out for a bit longer and then after being together for like seven years they go were getting engaged you wanna come to the party and you wanna say no youre really boring and we hate you but you go oh okay great youre still together are you you fucked one person have you oh how exciting and and then what they do is they dont have a kid right away because theyre still not ready we have to see how our careers are going and shit and what they do is they get a dog and then they act like the fucking dogs their baby they refer to it as their fucking baby they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog and it says from our family to yours and then you have a barbecue and you invite them the humans right then they come over this fucking dog runs in jumping over everything and youre like what the fuck is this shit and theyre like we had to bring him we bring our baby everywhere and you go well your baby is biting my actual baby can you control and then eventually they decide theyre gonna have a kid cause theyve learned so much from the dog and then they bring the kid back and the dog runs up like whats happening a new person and theyre like fuck off we dont love you anymore were going and they think theyve learnt something from the dog and they havent learnt anything what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the dog dies you go off you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog try to pass it off as the same dog what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the baby dies very hard to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easier if youre black or asian  boston no no no shut up i will not put up with racism at my shows okay im not saying cause they look the same im saying cause theyre easier to purchase   if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything it is that you can buy black and asian people im yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child going yolanda quick get hans bring him over come on  im gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit uhgun control now no wait before you dont get excited because the other people have guns the antigun people are like yeah do it jim no lets just  now before i start saying this i wanna say this right i believe in your right as americans to have guns im not trying to stop you from having guns all im saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the oh it doesnt matter i dont like guns right im gonna say some things that are just facts right in australia we had guns right right up until  in  australia had the biggest massacre on earth it still hasnt been beaten and now after that they banned the guns now in the  years before port arthur there was  massacres since the gun ban in  there hasnt been a single massacre since i dont know how or why this happened uh maybe it was a coincidence right now please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people right i get it in australia we had the biggest massacre on earth and the australian government went thats it no more guns and we all went yeah all right then that seems fair enough really now in america you had the sandy hook massacre where little tiny children died and your government went maybe well get rid of the big guns and  of you went fuck you dont take my guns  so heres where it gets confusing right now as i said i am all for your second amendment rights i think you should be able to have guns its in your constitution what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun and this is the argument fuck off i like guns its not the best argument but its all youve got and theres nothing wrong with it theres nothing wrong with saying i like something dont take it away from me but dont give me this other bullshit the main one is  i need it for protection i need to protect me i need to protect my family really is that why theyre called assault rifles is it ive never heard of these fucking protection rifles you speak of protection what the fuck are you talking about you have a gun in your house youre  more likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think well thatd never happen to me you dont know that because you know what from time to time we all get sad  one day youre happy then youre sad  and then uhoh protection i had a breakin in manchester england where i was tied up i had my head cut they threatened to rape my girlfriend they came through the window with a machete and a hammer and americans always go  well imagine if you had a gun and im like all right i was naked at the time i wasnt wearing my holster i wasnt staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through what world do you live in where youre constantly fucking ready you have guns cause you like guns thats why you go to gun conventions thats why you read gun magazines none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security conventions none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going fucking yeah like youre going to be ready if someone comes into your house you have it at all fucking times by the way most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv you think that people are coming to murder your family how many fucking enemies do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyones coming to murder you see if you have it readily available it becomes unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kids picks it up thinks its a toy shoots another one of your kids happens every fucking day but people go thatd never happen in my house cause im a responsible gun owner i keep my guns locked in a safe then theyre no fucking protection someone comes into the house youre like wait there fuckface oh youve come to the wrong house here buddy boy i tell you what im gonna fuck you up okay is it  to the left or  to the right your mothers birthday why the fuck would i know your fucking mothers birthday maybe if you didnt leave the window open  because its too hot in here we wouldnt be getting fucking murdered right i find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer is more guns after sandy hook happened the nra said and i quote none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns i i think theyre forgetting what school was like does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to whenever she came into school that relief teacher came you and your friends would see her and go  oh were gonna make her cry and then shed stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking and youd go youre never getting married are you miss never gonna happen for you then shed get back to her  volkswagen beetle and shed be crying over the steering wheel just why dont they like me lets give that cunt a gun and see how things work out  and then they go oh well answer to that well just add more guns they go well put an armed security guard at every school across america yeah thatll work out the average security guard in america earns  an hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero someone comes onto the school and  and youve got kevin now im sure kevins shithot at call of duty but it might not fucking cut it ladies and gentlemen now i understand that when im doing this joke in this room  of you agree with me  of you dont agree with me and i do respect the people who dont agree with me dont think i dont out of the  that dont agree with me  of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and its not to be taken seriously and theyre laughing along cause its just funny jokes right and then the next  have sort of phased out a little bit theyre looking around going wonder how they got that chandelier up there and then theres the last  and theyre fucking furious right now in this room and the people watching at home  of you are fucking seething just and for a couple of reasons first reason im making good points  second reason second reason second reason and this is the big one im foreign and thats pissing the fuck out of you right now and your brain is on a loop and you cant fucking turn it off and its just going around in a circle and youre just going if you dont like it go home if you dont like it go home and my answer to that is no i came here legally i pay my taxes ill say whatever the fuck i want your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks and unless youre an american indian youre a fucking immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it i understand that to americans your constitution is very important i respect it but please understand that every country has one as well its no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia i dont know what it says ive never seen it if theres a problem well check it but everythings going fine and dont get me wrong i get that the constitution is important to you i have had fucking i get it right ive had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as im leaving the theater going  you cannot change the second amendment and im like yes you can its called an amendment if you cant change something thats called an amendment see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you dont know what a thesaurus is get a dictionary and work your way forward dont think your constitution is set in stone youve changed things before you used to have prohibition in there right and then people were like hey who likes getting fucked up yeah i like getting fucked up too lets get that one out lets get that one out you used to have this other thing in america called uh slavery and then lincoln came along and went thats it no more slaves and  of you went fuck you dont take my slaves and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns why should i have my slaves taken off me im a responsible slave owner im trained in how to use my slaves safely just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesnt mean that my rights should be taken away from me i i use my slaves to protect my family i keep my slaves locked in a safe thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me ive done nothing wrong look i agree with you if youre a responsible gun owner and you dont fuck around with them then you should be allowed your guns you really should but thats not how society works we have to play to the  that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving right i take drugs like a fucking champion right  we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs but we cant can we because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids oh oh thanks sarah you fucked it up for everyone right everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we cant because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family thanks jonathan now i have to drive at  you fucking idiot see thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me im responsible just because that guys crazy whos to say youre not crazy thats the thing about crazy people they dont know theyre crazy thats what makes them crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth is i think therefore i am you know that you exist anything past that is open to interpretation right you know you exist and thats it right now i think im in boston talking to  people thats what i think im doing but there is a good to fair chance that im in a mental home standing in front of a white wall going  i hate guns i hate guns i hate guns  see one of the better arguments is well if you take the guns away then only the criminals will have guns not true when they banned the guns in australia it worked when they banned them in britain it worked okay the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs like  american and you can buy it in walmart itll be delivered to your house thats it man  bucks right that same gun in australia on the black market costs  now if you have  you dont need to be a criminal youve got  youre a great little saver keep going so that covers the criminals but that doesnt cover the people who wanna murder your family that are coming after you and your family it kind of does the people who do the massacres it covers them cause they go the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker lets say that he had some social issues the kid at sandy hook was aspergers as fuck right i dont know if you know a lot about the black market but you cant just rock up at the docks going  guns who wants to sell me a gun now im gonna wrap this up we wont talk about it anymore now see the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms i really agree with that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government became a bunch of cunts you could all get your guns and fight back and thats why it was written    yeah and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets but you do know the government has drones right you get that youre bringing guns to a drone fight if we went back to muskets im all for it keep the second amendment if we all have muskets muskets are awesome every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times you know whats good about the musket it gives you a lot of time to calm down someone calls your wife fat and youre like fuck you buddy ah youre not a bad guy youre all right now after the show were gonna go out have a big party around boston see how it goes im not allowed to go tostrip clubsanymore my girlfriend has said thats a no cause i dont behave myself in there so im not allowed to go to them anymore cause strip clubs arent what women think they are  it used to be like okay so when a man goes to a strip club its all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible thats what men want to see women when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are women wanna see a guy hey ladies hes a fireman and he comes out with his hose and like that and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off theyve still got the firemans hat on or a tool belt on or policemans gun on a holster right because even when a mans naked a woman wants to know that he has a job when men watch strippers we want them to have a job and that jobs stripping we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money and just go you cant take care of your kids its and when men get private dances in these strip clubs i dont know i dont know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms but basically its dry humping theres no dancing the girl gets in front she gets where your cock is pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face and you go thats what a private dance is right i dont know if theres private dancing in female strip clubs  i cant imagine that there would be i dont imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going she goes how was it and she goes well he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead i got to go to the atm solegitgot canceled  yeah i know i know it who wouldve thought it wouldve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about the first season is on netflix this special is being recorded for netflix so you can go watch it there if youre watching the special it was im very proud of it we had two great seasons of really good television and if people didnt now the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel which is a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who in the end we used dj qualls and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip hes the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle  flow and hes the white guy out of the movie hustle  flow now the great thing about dj is he already looks disabled he has that latter stages of aids thing going on its great for casting anyway but i didnt want dj to begin with i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actors union of america said you cannot do that because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy i think are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired and i said all right what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer and they sent me a list and on this list i said can you get rid of all the contagious ones and what have we got left so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood and ill be honest with you not that many of them i dont know why maybe theyre just lazy they dont wanna work maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly and none of them were very good either everyone we saw none of them were very good cause acting is all about what you do with your hands none of them knew what to do with their hands and they all came in until this one guy came in i had seen a lot of people that day this guy was the most disabled person id ever seen in my life he was like think of the most disabled person youve seen then double it really super disabled he was shaped like a pretzel he was being carried in by this big russian nurse carried him in he made that great disabled sound of  that one i just loved him anyway so he comes in for the audition and im sitting there and were doing the lines together and at first i didnt know if he was mentally all there either so i was being a little bit patronizing i was going thank you so much for coming in and then we did the dialog together and i didnt have to worry about a thing this kid was funny he was smart his timing was impeccable i thought he was just great and i helped him out of the room and i come back to the director and i said thats our guy thats who we gotta pick and he agreed but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheels himself in now obviously hes just a paraplegic if hes wheeling himself in which means the waist down and that didnt really suit me because paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but i thought if hes a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role so he comes in he comes in i shake his hand and his leg slightly comes out at the same time and i went whoa whats going on there kicky and he goes oh you got me im not disabled and i said youre fucking what now and he goes im not disabled i just really wanted the role so i rented a wheelchair and i said just shut up so let me this is how your day has mappedout thus far you woke up this morning you drove to the wheelchair rental place you rented a wheelchair you carried it out i assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drove here you got the wheelchair out you carried it up three flights of stairs you went to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sat in it and practiced your lines and he went yeah and i said youre a fucking asshole mate get the fuck out of here and i kicked him out and later on that day im sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors im gonna call to tell them theyve got parts and im holding this disabled guys headshot and i just think im gonna call this guy up im gonna change his life this is an awesome moment right and im looking at it and he looks super handsome in his headshot he looked really like and i thought this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history the shutter on his camera has gotta be like  like  and then i read the guys biography and then it dawned on me this guys not disabled either i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair this cunt rented a nurse do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse im all for a method actor get into character three hours before but once you finish the audition stand up and go tada and we would have gone that was very good but ill tell you what you dont do dont make me carry you to your car i carried him down three flights of stairs going you did very good hes like thank you jim   i was uh i go to atherapist cause i get depressed so i got a therapist every now and again i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like im gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind like just out of the movies right and she went red and i went blue and then she went cooking and i went food and all that type of stuff we went like this forever and then she went for the last question she went and whats your favorite thing in the world and i wentcoming on a girls facenow now i couldve said things like ice cream is a good answer hank wouldve been an excellent answer but i said coming on a girls face and ive had six months to think about my answer and i stand by it  i   im not proud of it i hate myself for thinking it its such a horrible thing to do to another human when a girls on her knees and you its so and as an atheist i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote but he never had a bit where he explained that there was never a bit in his book where he went when a caveman loves a cavewoman hell ejaculate on her face so that flies wont come near there was never that never that moment but by golly if its not fun i find it to look to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time

come off his mothers face i thinki did something illegal with my sonthe other day i think it might be illegal tell me if this is illegal all right im in the shower my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning and when she came back i was in the shower and hank ran up and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like argh like that and i went  and i saw his little face and i went hello hankie and then in the condensation i drew a little bowtie on him and a little suit and then i gave him a voice bubble that said i love my daddy love hank but i did it so i could read it well of course he could read the k and then i stepped out i stepped out of the bathroom and i went gday hankie and he slapped my cock and he ran off now is that illegal i dont know is it illegal because a a child touched my cock or because b i found it really funny and ive been telling everyone and i cant get angry at him because his whole life hes been lying on mats with things dangling over hes been training for this his entire life i think ive uh i thinkive become american more american than i am australian lately and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went oh i think like an american person now and im happy to do it i just ill tell you what happened i was flying around i was doing a tour of australia and i was flying domestically around australia and im so used to airports and stuff here in america that okay what happens is when you go i was flying sydney to melbourne when you fly domestically in australia you go up to the machine put your name in prints your ticket out it prints your bag thing you put the bag thing on your bag yourself and then theres a conveyor belt underneath you throw your bag on bag fucks off you dont speak to anyone then i go up to the gate bit and the ladys going tickets please and im holding my id out like a fucking simpleton cause i get through airports quick man im like fucking there you go and she went put your id away i dont need to see that and i went i think you do and she went i dont why would i need to see your id and i said i might be a terrorist and she went would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up no id probably still blow the plane up so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing and im so good at the airports im already taking my shoes off as im walking right and all the australians behind me assume that im american and theyre losing their fucking shit theyre like oh for fucks sake one of these cunts eh and the tsa guy goes hey mate what are you taking your shoes off for and i went  i dont know maybe theyre bombs and he went but theyre not are they i put me shoes back on i get my laptop out everyones going mental and the tsa guy says very politely but extraordinarily sarcastically he goes jeez mate thats a nice computer why are you showing it to everyone it might also be a bomb and then the guy said the most australian thing ive ever heard come out of anyones mouth ever he went oh come on mate you wouldnt have two bombs   im not even quite sure what that means but it does make some type of sense all rightoscar pistorius if you havent been following the case youre missing out this is the greatest thing since oj simpson youre fucking missing out mate if you dont know who oscar pistorius is let me fill you in oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa known as the blade runner he ran in two olympics the disabled and the ablebodied olympics in one year no one has ever done that hes an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and ablebodied people alike and on valentines day last year he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth and thats when he became an inspiration to me cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there you cant just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want  people have feelings you cunts now theres a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day one of the theories is that they found in her phone he went through her phone and on her phone he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentines day right now i dont know if youve ever been to south africa but in south africa rugby is more popular than legless running it goes rugby legless running cricket legless runnings their second sport you wouldnt have thought that anyway im going to reenact what i believe happened that day to do that i will now be doing a south african accent now i know many of you cant tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent heres the difference picture my accent but im punching a black person what im trying to say is south africans are horrible people so shes coming out of the shower shes been drying her hair shes listening to rodriguez or something she comes out hes laying on the bed he looks up at her hes holding the phone and he goes  what the fuck is this ive been through your phone you have been texting a rugby player and shes like oh fuck you who the fuck do you think you are who am i im oscar pistorius the greatest legless runner that has ever been thats who the fuck i am well i would rather be with a rugby player at least he is a whole man not a threequarter man like you    i know  oh fuck you no fuck you im leaving you and then she storms out of the room and then he was like you fucking bitch  i hate you  you will rue the day that you left oscar pistorius the blade runner dont go anywhere  i hate you thats where he keeps his legs all right then he put the blades on oh youre in trouble missy i tell you i go to my gun safe she locked herself in the bathroom he shot her through the bathroom door seems like overkill doesnt it bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them but oscars one of the few men on earth that couldnt kick the door in right he was wearing the blades so boing ah so i think oscar will probably go to prison now in south africa one in four people have aids i assume it may even be worse in the prison population now can i say this look ive never raped a man i hate that i have to put a man in that sentence but whatever ive never raped a man but if i was going to rape a man it would be a legless olympian cause in prison its all about getting one up on other people and making people think youre tough and all that like you want to fucking rape me i just raped an olympian bitch is that what you fucking want thered be a wonderful moment when youre in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of aterminatormovie  you know what i like about that joke so often when you tell a joke the rapist is the villain in the story but not in that one not in that one hes the hero all right we have to get going soon before i leave  i thank you very much for coming   no i said soon not over its just soon you cunts so calm down   i always i always find that weird when someone like whistles like that what do they think is going to happen like im going to go fucking you know me mate i was enjoying claps and cheers but what i needed was a highpitched squeal noise thank god you came along to pick up my spirits  love you all right final story now i was insouth africaagain jeez i dont think ill be working in south africa after this special comes out i used to do like one tour in south africa every year and i just dont know if ill be invited this time theyll be like  we dont like him hes no good anyway so im in south africa and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles which is like a  flight youve to go up to london and go across cunt of a trip um but it was all right cause i had a business class ticket so i didnt give a fuck and when i travel economy i try to dress up nice cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade but when ive already got a business class ticket i try to look like a bag of shit cause its important to me that everyone else in business class doesnt want me there and theyre annoyed by my presence so im wearing a white tshirt thats got brown stains on it with a hole in the side im wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out so anyway i go up to the counter up to the business thing with the thing and i go hello and the lady goes  oh mr jefferies im so sorry butyou have been downgraded i said you what now she goes business class is full you have been downgraded and i said i understand that business class is full i bought one of the tickets that made it full and she went im sorry sir theres nothing i can do and then i just went are you fucking kidding me now you know when youre dealing with customer service people and they want you to swear cause as soon as you swear they dont have to engage with you anymore they can act like theyre the first adult never to hear a swear word and they can get really offended right so i went are you fucking kidding me and she went please do not speak to me that way i have done nothing wrong and i said are you a white south african telling me youve done nothing wrong anyway tensions rose the manager comes over big fat cunt called simon fulcher right he walks over and goes  what is wrong here what is wrong and i said i bought a business class ticket and i want a business class ticket and he goes what do you want me to do make a new chair for you there are no more seats i cant do anything he goes ill tell you what i can do go up to the executive lounge have some peanuts enjoy a beverage listen to rodriguez and if something opens up we will move you back up to business class so i thought theres nothing i can do so i walk off with my ticket im walking through the airport like fucking british airways bunch of fucking cunts right i get up to the counter and the woman behind the counter said tickets please and i hand over my ticket and she goes  im sorry sir but this is for business class passengers only your ticket says economy on it and i said  i bought a business class ticket but you people have downgraded and as i was doing my little speech she looked past me and went next  listen here you fucking cunt  all right now you say cunt in any foreign country people lose their fucking shit security came from everywhere i was going dont you fucking come near me cunt and i said i want to speak to simon fulcher like im and they go all right they ring the manager up and then they go he goes is it the pale australian man and the guy went yes he goes weve had problems with him let him through right so i go through im sitting there im eating my peanuts and im just angry now going fucking british airways fucking cunts fucking like that and in walks in a group of americans about  of them you know the type right they all and whenever i see americans abroad ill do my impersonation of any american abroad when americans are abroad youre just pointing out shit you see youre just walking around going  oh this is great look at that thats a chair right there okay oh whats that over there okay wonderful great right and this group walked in and one of the women in the group went like this she went  did anyone else see that australian guy speaking to that lady out there some people have no class and i put my head around the pylon and i went you can fuck off and all you dont know what ive been through ive been downgraded and as i said that  other people who were given the same lie that i was given that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class the penny dropped none of us are getting promoted they all lied to us and we formed an angry militia in seconds it was like a scene out ofbraveheart and they all stood up and went fucking downgraded and the woman in the group was doing this dont speak to me that way who the hell do you think you are and all the men in the group were like hey why dont you shut the fuck up just shut the fuck up  it doesnt matter these people seem very angry so  and a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down and sometimes americans sometimes you can seem a little insincere and he came up and he went  hey hey yeah i get it  downgraded yeah that really grinds my gears i tell you that yeah i would write a stronglyworded letter i really would and then i thought at least this guys being nice and i said look mate dont worry about it its not like its your fault and i said why are you in such a big group anyway and he goes oh were inneil diamonds band thats neil diamonds backup singer you just called a cunt there and as he said that neil diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero and i reacted like he was one i went neil diamond and neil diamond went  hey whats going on and then for a second there there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe neil diamond could solve problems and i went neil me and all these people weve been downgraded and neil went oh oh right uh well maybe thats our fault we decided to come back a day early you can fuck off and all neil diamond and then a fight breaks out amongst the neil diamond band and the downgraded punches are thrown not by me i dont know if you have the internet but im not much of a fighter im an excellent scurrierawayer i get down hey what have you got there hiya anyway the airport police came three people were arrested from the downgraded but three people were arrested from the neil diamond band and that meant that three seats opened up in business class  ladies and gentlemen thank you very much good night appreciate it   thank you go home lets have a drink bye '"

seeing you what youre a legend shut up what is he im not a god im just an ordinary guy you know going round talking to people sort sort of like jesus in a way but better well ive actually turned up so

friends they guard us they guide us theres medical detection dogs that can smell if youve got aids im not a doctor but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours so they go cor youre well hiv fuck you know and you go you can smell aids on someone yeah why didnt you smell it on the bloke i brought home last night you fucking idiot they did the first three billion years by themselves evolution and all that then we got involved and did some selective breeding getting them how we wanted to do jobs for us bit stronger faster whatever theyre great at the jobs theyre bred to do they love the job theyre bred to do theyre genetically hardwired to love that behavior although the rhodesian ridgeback was bred to hunt lions i cant help but think it was a shock to it when it found out so weve got all the pedigrees for miles around a big passingout parade theres a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard he goes right dogs they go what who wants to know what job they got we all do we all do okay labradors yeah do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks yeah thats your job amazing that is amazing that is my favorite job that is my favorite job jack russells yeah you

boy good boy you shake that baby if you want good boy cheers this is my first new standup for seven years if you dont count thegolden globes which you shouldnt the golden globesvery different god a different vibe two hundred million people watching and its live big thrill but with that many people watching theres a bit of stick everyones different everyones a blogger everyone goes i was offended why he said an horrible thing he said loads of horrible things yeah but that was a thing that i care about thats the thing about offense its about personal feelings i dont care about the backlash comedian in hot water you know my girlfriend jane she worries and she reads things what have you said dont worry they wont come to the house fuck em so i wind her up i pretend im gonna say much worse things than i ever would i have to make up worse jokes than i actually just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before its in la we fly out im writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick i got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson ill introduce him yes about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said i got a good intro she went what i said bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren i didnt do it she said you wont do that i said no next day i got her again i said is this too much i said not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy i didnt do it i would never id never tell a joke like that its horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane id never even think of that so dont even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said ill startwith a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke she went what i said what did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas jane went i dont know i said cancer i didnt do it so youre getting offended at a joke that doesnt exist so id never say that in public so to anyone who mattered anyway so dont i didnt have to worry about offending anyone it just happens the big controversy last time i did it was acaitlyn jennerjoke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going it was transphobic it wasnt transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and thats the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target theyre not necessarily the same ill tell you the joke you make your minds up its live so they go your host for the  annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais theyre all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously its brilliant right so i just go relax im gonna be nice tonight ive changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously and i gonow caitlyn jenner of course and what a year shes had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didnt do a lot for women drivers thats a clever joke ill tell you why right its layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes im playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying shes a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if shes a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car lets not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress thats the target of the joke just so were clear okay she was interviewed a week later at apress conference for a show of hers now cancelled and one of the press said what do you think of the ricky gervais joke she went maybe i should host the golden globes and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously i just sent back let her host just dont let her drive another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais i just sent back at last she always brakes too late bring it on bring it on but im a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying why is it transphobic they said its about a trans person thats ridiculous thats like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but im willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her id never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathletehe was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big famous man with a huge i dont know im guessing probably he was big but ive learnt my lesson now i know its wrong id never deadname her now but years ago when she was a man years ago im saying and she went to the doctor and knocked on the door the doctor went come in this is years ago id never deadname her now but this is like a flashback before anyone you know what so so like come in and he went hello bruce jenner because that that was his name then the doctor this was years ago the doctor went all right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy and bruce jenner that washis name this is years ago right so bruce jenner went yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah what can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy and bruce jenner went that was his name bruce jenner went look at that the doctor went come on bruce jenner you know the rules he uses his whole name every time for some reason come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you cant bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate bruce jenner went no thats not my pole thats my enormous penis well seeing as its your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside and bruce jenner went that was his name for fiftyeight years i think he went no theyre not my shot puts doctor theyre my enormous testicles thats where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went oh yeah that makes perfect im a medical man youre a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy youre a big youre big and you would have a big old cock and balls theyre beautiful bit familiar innit no you must be very proud of them bruce bruce went this is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them and the doctor went what why oh they get in the way in the way of what fucking driving for one thing so im engaging these people and im saying but i had to sayher old name thats the joke i say ive changed not as much as bruce jenner then i do the joke but no this is my second crime i say she hasnt changed shes always identifiedas a woman that means shes a woman fine if thats the rules if you feel youre a woman you are im not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i dont think its going far enough cause ive always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say im a chimp i am a chimp preop but dont ever deadname me dont call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo im gonna have species realignment im halfway there im short with short legs and long arms i stoop my backs getting hairier by the day ive got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like so i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say im a chimp ive got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy thatd be lovely im gonna stay a male chimp so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so you know i reckon thats got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp were so close than for a man to turninto a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off and a hole gouged out into im not a doctor but that is the gist of it i know which one id rather have done im not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i cant see you but to me every single one of you is equal to a chimp so so id have all that done hair and that id do all that all the ill retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies im talking to jane shes going what is it what is it bobo you left the fucking oven on theres a fire are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole shed revert shed be over that fucking easy so id have all that done top lip doing all that right ill be legally a chimp ill be well properly chimpedup ill be able to use chimp toilets ill be walking along holding janes hand come on bobo right we dont hold hands now i dont know why shes all over me now im a chimp but well be all in love maybe matching jumpers come on bobo in love just two like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes thats fucking disgusting ill fling shit at him and run up a tree and thats why that joke isnt transphobic so cheers so humanitywhat is humanitywhat are we well weve touched upon it there were great apes not metaphorically were literally great apes we are  genetically identical to a chimpanzee were closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is our parents mate were born we grow we mate our parents die our friends die and then we die now my sevenyearold niece didnt like hearing that but i said youve gotta learn stop crying i said youre seven you know today so any more grizzling and this partys cancelled so lets take the first of those birth its odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early thats why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb thats why were so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes im proper pregnant right im gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes mum its got to be fucking ready were were helpless right just think nine months were growing in this perfect environment everythings its like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly youre being squeezed out of an hole near an ass youre covered in shit theres screaming you go i cant breathe someone goes yes you fucking can the first one second of lifeon earth you dont know where you areyou cant choose where youre born i wasborn in whitley estate in reading right i wouldnt have chosen that id have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous its a rarefied place its like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i dont know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didnt get mugged or molested there werent many pedophilesin reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god theres no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him bender it was weird i know my life has changed drastically it wasnt always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying hes out of touch hes so famous hes rich hes megarich i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like hes an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary scum and i say i say dont call them scum right but even the papers they try and get around to it i do interviews and theyll always say do you always fly first class i go no often private right the number of times ive answered this question they say do you know how much a pint of milk is to make you look out of touch i dont know but thats irrelevant next time a journalist asks me ill say i dont know but heresa grand run and get me one is that enough that enough yeah another question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece theyre still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things likeyou dont have childreni say no why dont you have children which is an odd question why dont you have children as opposed to asking people why do you have children lets ask the fat lady in the leggings why shes had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didnt even touch the sides or disturb her cigarette that one just go and claim for that people say its selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bringa life into the world that doesnt exist on any level theres not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going we want to be born right but ive thought about it and theres three reasons i dont have children three main reasons and ill share them with you three reasons one theres millions the worlds overpopulated noones going ricks not having kids were gonna run out fuck two kids are scroungers arent they i mean from day one its all me me me isnt it feed me clothe me pay for my chemotherapy no no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it costs the average household in the west  to bring up a child and they dont want to pay you back theyre not grateful they dont go thanks for having me its i didnt wanna be born even if they get a top job which they wont youll never see that money back theyll just put you in a home okay and my kid hed be born into ridiculous wealth wouldnt he so hed be a little cunt a little hampstead cunt running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts being all hampstead and cunty im a little hampstead cunt yes i know these are my cunty friends i know its obvious i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that youre little hampstead cunts you little posh hampstead first hed know he was a little hampstead cunt im a little yes we know everyone knows right hed know that right on the other hand hed know hed never live up to being as brilliant as his dad id say i worked my way up from nothing and youre just a

family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesnt take much il give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew were met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time youre horrified everyones looking pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went wheres that bloke im not queueing its quick when i fly to the states ive got a place there but im always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesnt get any better even if i was paying id still go first class but jane would probably be in coach its ten grand a pop that newplanet of the apesmovies on shell love that shell be up for that but when someone else is paying i say jane get up here with me right front two seats they board us early were on the plane about  minutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne its great its like a day off no phone or anything its likea holiday flying to the statesi could do without thesafety video thats always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain at  miles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked youre going down the plane smashes you go ill try it you do that ball of flames you wake up everyones dead you go fucking hell thats amazing that is and they always use that voice dont they that calming hypnotic voice like nothing bad will happen theyre saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because im using this voice dont worry things like in the event of the plane landing on water it smashes the fuck to bits right they say in the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyones dead except you by a miracle youre bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is youve got about  minutes before hypothermia sets in or youre eaten by a shark or you drown youre hoping theyve sent airsea rescue youre going god imgonna die i dont know what im doing hold on i mean air sea rescue i dont know if youve ever beenin a helicopter o course you havent but theyre fucking loud its like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle its like like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die right but apart from that its brilliant right i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round champagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais she goes off i go have you gotany of them warm nuts she went were not handing outnutson this flight a ladys getting on whos so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction i went oh my god of course i was fuming i mean whats that got to do with me why cant i eat nuts just cause fucking this woman will die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you if being just near a nut how has she never been near a nut before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly its and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean i never wanted nuts more i felt she wasinfringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought oh i wish id brought my own nuts on right i thought for a second but that wouldnt work shed get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that and die and someone would go ricky gervais brought his own nuts on you know right so i dont take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over in nuts just in case then i go can i have any nuts they go no sorry this lady would die yeah not a problem lady gets on sits down starts blowing up like a frog i go whats the matter i touch her all over whats the matter she goes nuts right and dies and i go whos been eating nuts i get off scotfree so i got to america i went on a chat showtonight show with jimmy fallon and i told that story the whole thing it went well audience laughed great went out next day on twitter outrage by outrage i mean one person going how dare you this woman goes i saw you onjimmy fallonmaking fun of nut allergies my daughters nutintolerant how dare you i go who is this woman shes tweeted  times she starts ing nbc and jimmy fallon i go whats this how many followers twentythree ignore it you know when youre being told off and they use your own words against you like a teacher going so you find so and so funny and cause the teachers really angry yes you do find that thing funny whatever she said would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog yeah yeah you saying that yes if you said that at the funeral i would yeah so someone else gets involved ohio moms against nuts right and she does a blog and theyre talking to each other and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am one filmed her little girl put it on youtube and sent me it i opened it sweet little girl seven years old and she went dear mr gervais i have a fatal nut allergy delete not my problem right ignore ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause im this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isnt as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said you should never make jokes about food allergies i should have left it right i sent back i make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and youre telling me i should never joke about food allergies she sent back yesbut the holocaust didnt kill children well it did didnt it it was horrible the holocaust some would say as bad as food allergies didnt kill children jesus it did kill children hitler killed  million people many of them children i have to say hitler you couldnt make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible but if i was throwing a dinner party and id been slaving over a hot stove and i was getting everything ready and there was one place left and i had to either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies i know whod ruin that party more everyones enjoying it everything okay ja istyummy right hes loving it i go cheers you fucker how you doing boy shes going i cant eat that fucking hell who wants ferrero rocher me all right here i cant eat them oh fuck off home rightthats what the worlds likepeople see something they dont like they expect it to stop as opposed to deal with their emotions they want us to care abouttheir thing as much as they do its why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think ive lived through the best  years of humanity  to  the peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now its going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybe im not saying this because im old old people say things like oh everything was better when i was a kid course it was you were a kid everythings better when youre a kidbeing oldis the shit bit whatevers happening being old is i wake up these days and i go oh fuck i didnt die gotta do it all again im usually hung over headache liver pains i cant walk for the first five minutes cause ive got no joints in my knees im getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort of  years were what i call my eating years and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was about  years old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor and i was saying to jane im having a heart attack right and honestly my heart rate was like  i felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because id eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like python swallow a pig whole and then its just fucked its like itll sit there for a week its like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasnt having a heart attack but it worried jane she said you gotta look after yourself i thought youre right  so i started working out right every day i didnt give anything up i dont eat meat anymore but i was having   caloriesa day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lost  pounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically cantburn off the calories i cant do enough cause im so old and broken and tired so im going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to die imlosing my hair its getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right ill have to buzz that off soon id never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think youve got away with it you havent everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wighas come into the room before i do right i could be at a party itll go theres a wig in here i go is there yes there is yeah spidey senses for the wig its obvious the way they smile like nothings wrong hiya its the telltale signs isnt it i was put off wigs for life bymy uncle reginald great bloke hes dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house elvis what is i was about eight i said to auntie edna what happened she went it was a miracle they were lying they were just everyone knew he was bald but hed embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well theyre going yeah it just grew back theres so much he wouldnt do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we werent allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said reg is allergic to balloons he wasnt allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room weve got photos in the family album if hes at a wedding or a christening and hes holding a baby its always at arms length like that so it cant grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasnt scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes cancer hows the chemo going uncle not a problem weve got a photo of him the last year i think he was  it must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it hes wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternity but i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and ill and blind and deaf and shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket youre ready because youre warned you know about getting old what they dont talk about so youre not prepared and it was a shock to me i only found out recently ill share it with you nowthe distending testicles see you dont know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasnt checking them or anything i didnt see em for  years as a young man they were pert and now theyre like two plums in a sock i dont know when it happened but it was recently they just and this is how i found out so as ive been getting older and theyve been secretly stretching away as ive got older ive got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and theyre floating right now id never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like theyd be heavy you could tie things down with them and theyd sink you know most people never see their in the sea youre in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths arent usually that deep that was my first thought oh my god i never thought testicles would float then my second thought kicked in hold on this baths two feet deep right im sitting on the bottom theyre on top whats going on right and i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact theyd created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle im just thinking this is bizarre fucking hell right and i thought maybe its a fluke so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up theyre really theyre really buoyant right try it when you get home if youre in your  and a man obviously or caitlyn jenner but but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise onsocial media because twitter and facebook thats where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was like me agree with me it falls into two tribes i dont agree with them so i block them and now in this posttruth era people dont care about the argument they say whos saying the argument no theyre not on our side its ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion weve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now its my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying i believe the earth is  years old i believe youre a fucking idiot you cant have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didnt want to make a mistake and theres a ridiculous thing of lets ask the average person what they think lets stop asking the average person what they do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say do not drink right lets take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but its not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like tweet us your news dont let them tweet you the news i saw a tyrannosaurus rex you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said weve looked at everything and weve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so were going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldnt happen again that would have been it but the guy went we asked the public what they thought then there was three banal vox pops first one said i already pay  a year so im not happy the next one said it takes me  minutes each way its not good enough the last one said i say its better to arrive at work late than dead why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted youre in early ted oh ted weve been through this remember i said id rather you arrive late than dead but the big enemy is stupidity right i wanna share with youthe most stupid tweeti ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyones opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are still  countries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say its fine to be an atheist its fine to believe in god and its fine not to thats all i was saying i realized i didnt have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people id tweet things like happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today someone would always go we know what youre fucking doing this is a tweet i gotafter one of those and it was all in capitals which excited me thats the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger its great right i looked at his profile sure enough hes a gentleman from texas hes a fundamentalist creationist christian which is fine he loves god he loves god and fetuses mainly he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay and then hes remember its in capitals hes shouting at me best tweet ever your science my science right science by the way is spelled scients already good isnt it i mean hes obviously heard the word he took a guess never seen it written down because its not in the bible so hes your scients wont help you well it will its helping him beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me your scients wont help you when satan of course he believes in satan why not he believes that god made the universe in six days youre not gonna say to him do you believe in satan and have him say bit farfetched why doesnt god kill satan thats what id ask him if i was wrong and i met god id go oh you do exist hed go yeah id go ive got a few fucking questions mate the first one would be why did you make chocolate kill dogs mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put the male gspot up the arse what what is wrong with you then id say why dont you kill satan and hed go what id go why dont you kill satan if he does all the bad stuff and you doall the good stuff which you want i mean you do want yes yeah you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy yeah why dont you kill him then because shut up your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass and hes got a point because if i die and i find myself in hell being raped by satan science has pretty much let me down but its this last line that he just throws away the line he signs off with makes this the best tweet ive ever received your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass ill be laughing so hes there too hes so hes a fundamentalist christian whos lived his life by the old and new testaments he dies he wakes up in hell right which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma oh my god im in hell oh my god why have you forsaken me im gonna be tortured for eternity he sees me getting raped and goes ha ha ha hes suddenly over it is he his days suddenly got a little bit brighter and like hes not next right so im getting raped right by the devil right hes just there you fucking atheist scum and im like that yeah whatever i assume it happens all eternity yeah yeah whatever like that i might say watch your hooves on my testicles and hed go why are they so distended and i go oh like youre brad pitt you know what i mean sorry are we talking or raping can we you lying fucking atheist hes probably bored fucking atheists every fucking day right his little gargoyle comes up satan he goes what and i go yeah what he goes theres a fundamentalist christian fuck this hed be on him like a ton of bricks so i got that tweet i loved it all i did was retweet right and just watch the fun people piling on going ah loser and hes fighting back really witlessly saying things like go fuck your sister you english faggot that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again its still all going off right its really funny im laughing at all the replies people saying things to him im scrolling down theres one tweet directly to me from this woman she saysyou find rape funnyno no what no your mates find rape funny no listen right you find rape funny listen everyone listen right no i said to her i didnt tweet that she went you retweeted it to show hes an idiot but you must find it funny or amusing its not a frivolous thing i said no well its up to him isnt it he can do it now im arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but im fighting for his right to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because im so conscious of freedom of speech what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didnt say what you find jokes about rape funny she said what you find rape funny the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying it was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling thats never so i sent back you mean jokes about rape she said yes i went depends on the joke it fucking doesnt im going no it does it does it depends on the joke its about contextits about content what do you mean by a rape joke she said even a joke with the word rape in it is unacceptable i said thats ridiculous it depends what the joke is i tweeted that clip of me inthe office going i think theres been a rape up there everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man whos so narcissistic hell say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i saidsome jokes dont punch up or down they dont punch anywhere they can just be a pun a playon words that dont really mean anything a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it ill tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says help ive been graped the policeman says do you mean raped she says no there was a bunch of them that is a rape joke right so and i even said to her no i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokesthey are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting id never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying well okay i see your point but still i will laugh at a joke with the word rape in it when noone in the audience has been raped i should have left it i just sent back what a weird door policy you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says can i just ask you a question yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you cant come in what why a lady says she wont laugh if youre in off you go thats what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly ontwitter im not tweeting anyone im just tweeting i dont know whos following me ive got  million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally thats like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying guitar lessons and you go but i dont fucking want guitar lessons whats this theres a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i dont fucking want any fine its not for you then just walk away dont worry about iti should say one thing in twitters defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally im very intoanti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to get  signatures on a petition standing outside tescos or something thats the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament ive been part of many campaigns through twitter when weve got  signatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those whove retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no ones gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard ill tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say ban bullfighting someone always says what about the kids in syria what well im not giving you a choice you can do both im not saying throw that kid back in the hole theres a bull here and theres one thing that i didnt want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter theres a thing called theyulin dog meat festival in china every year and its horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back its a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people dont really read it its a kneejerk people say racist i go what they go we eat pigs and cows in the west yep we do i dont but yeah i used to youre right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog its not about the species its what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and theyre skinning this dog alive its screaming theyre laughing its the worst thing ive ever seen i thought ive got to tweet that i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said one beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said is that language necessary i should have left it right but i was i was incensed i said youre more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death she said i just hate the cword i definitely should have left it i sent back people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didnt go round acting like such cunts thank you youve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so much i hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do thats not the point ive always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think its my upbringing i grew up in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it wasmy older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized hes healing them thats what comedys for what humors for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much everything was just to see if he could break this poor mans will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and hed get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought hed won the argument and hed tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought if it lookedrespectable wed be respectable it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read is that pedophile postman still reading your mail and shed take it shed go in and shed be horrified shed call bob he saw it this time you must stop doing that even at her funeral my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mums funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right wed never been to church he didnt know us we didnt know him so he said to bob tell me about your mum so i can say a few words bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said well she was a keen racist the vicar went i cant say that bob said okay put she liked gardening he was trying to getthe vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didnt warn us and he did get something by the vicar so were called ricky robert bob ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out hes a standup guy larry so bob gives the vicar the wrong name didnt warn us were all in church start of the funeral were all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and we snort like that right bobs going everyone realizes were all laughing we see larry go all right and the church is like every time we thought of it wed see larry go like that right then wed just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicars thinking what have i said right hed put in a few things the vicar didnt know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying id come prepared with a pack of tissues theyd take one and hand it on before the funeral id taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said snivelling fucking bitch and theyre sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we allstarted fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said sorry was that okay me and bob wentfucking brilliantmate it was fucking brilliant thats what i mean were allgonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity youre bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny youve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well it might go badly but youve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right so were all in the car one day bobs driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and theres a british bobby there and he stops the car bobs at the window he said where are we off to bob went bognor he wentcan you just pop the boot please so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bobs window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet of  cigarettes and the copper went bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets and bob went i knew it wasnt fucking brains youve been amazing good night prolefeed '"
