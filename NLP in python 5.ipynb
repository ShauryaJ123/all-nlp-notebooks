terrifying incident of helping his landlord search for an intruder and his reflections on misleading childhood fears the performance culminates in a playful yet pointed critique of game shows urging the audience to disrupt unfair tactics if they ever find themselves on the price is rightpremiered may    yeah all right i chose chicago for the special because i love i love chicago matter of fact i was here four years ago i was out to get lunch and i had an experience here in chicago that i have never been able to get rid of really i havent been able to shake iti was sitting next to a couple a guy and a girl two people they ordered two large pizzas and they finished them two people they ordered two large pizzas and they finished all but a slice okay you ever sit next to people having a conversation and youre listening the words coming out of their mouth are so ridiculous that you feel in your heart that you have to butt in on behalf of societyat the end of this meal the woman turned to her husband and said hun dont even get the car well walk it off i was like walk it off i hope you live in kalamazoo because crunching some numbers carry the two you need to get going you two need to leave now walk it off i suggest a sensible shoe and a canteen because you have so far to walk walk it off shes talking about it like it was a charlie horse i just watched you two eat  slices a serving is one i didnt say that i didnt say any of that ill tell you what happened i stayed quiet finished my whole pizza i didnt say i was walking it off though so it probably still is with me as a matter of factas soon as she said that i jumped on my phone i had to i googled it the average pizza  calories thats without toppings she had two lets not even talk about those you have to understand something we walk  mph as human beings and in an hour we burn  calories which means that the woman from chicago would have had to walk for  hours  hours or  miles thats the math ive done it many times ive been alive for decades okay ive lived in seven locations theyve all been within nine miles of each other this woman has to walk the length of the great lakes because she wanted double sausagei have regretted not saying something to this woman so badly that i think of her in my regular life for four years i have thought of this woman from chicago i think about her in the shower when im trying to fall asleep you know when i walk and i flew into chicago yesterday and i got like ptsd i was like chicago the woman i am so obsessed that i didnt say anything that this is where im at with this situation okay if somebody invented time travel i wouldnt even use that to like go back and save a bunch of people id go four years ago wicker park in the pizzeria and give this bitch these statistics  pm id kick the pizzeria door but id excuse myself miss im from the future are you prepared to walk until around this time tomorrow no well then everybody in the pizzeria thinks youre being very unreasonable then i turn to myself you too put it down it doesnt come off i should walk more things off i dont walk i dont go out i dont leave my house anymorei turned  years old in november  and thats where it fell off for me this is how much i dread going out seriously recently it was my best friend mikes birthday weve been friends for  years i still didnt want to go out just to get me through the night of my best friends birthday for the first time in my life i took a  energy you have experience yeah this is how bad i didnt want to go out this is how much i dreaded it i took two  energies no yeah i dont need to read the directions because i know that clearly means i get  consecutive hours of evenly distributed energy that should subside right around that last minute i had  hours of energy the second i swallowed i basically did cocaine with vitamin  i would have punched a child if one came across me i would punch a little boy right in his mouth and then asked him if he wants to start a crypto business thats how quickly i was out of my gourd okay i took  of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin  i was like its my birthday nowwe went out we drank heavy on top of that when it was time to come home im responsible i took an uber home and the uber was a fivestar ride pristine but when i got out of the uber i was so hopped up still on the energy and all the alcohol that i accidentally hit one star and i hit submit let me finish im neurotic as it is he pulled away i had a full meltdown i was afraid i ruined this mans life i was like oh my god this guys going to get fired from his uber i was thinking the worst i was like he probably has a bakers dozen worth of children they all need braces probably i sat down at  in the morning on the stoop of a home that i didnt know who lived there it wasnt me and i swear to you these words came out of my mouth oh my god this guys kids and i realized in that moment ill go in the app you can write to them if you have an issue so ah thats what i did that night i went into the app in that state of mind in that condition and i wrote to uber to save this man and his children i forgot about it i found it in my phone four months later i have the letter on me right now im going to read this to you guysi need you to keep a few things in mind okay this is a combination of  minutes of energy titos handmade vodka and autocorrect autocorrect does some of the heavy lifting here it starts off like this to ubbs it may concern next sentence everythings going great all caps coming in hot on that second sentence all caps five exclamations why am i pissed off all of a sudden what happened between the first and second sentence its not like someone at uber was like you know sir im sorry its too late we just got word his daughters are all selling their bodies also its  am and im trying to reach a human up at the uber office so it is not going greatcroutons thats the next sentence thats the subject the verb and the predicate croutons fucking period croutons is what i told them i said croutons croutons i have a major emergency here this guys kids teeth hang in the balance i told them croutons call a meeting figure it out i thought about croutons i thought about that sentence for a while too because because because what autocorrects to croutons what the hell was i trying to say that the iphone  was like no no no trust us he means croutons thats what the boy means yes we here at apple believe the boy meant the cubes of bread you put in your salads and your soups thats the end of the letter to uber if youre paying attention i didnt even mention a star this guy this guy has  kids running around the city that can never smile with confidenceto ubbs it may concern everythings going great tell your children i said youre welcome what did i even do there thats not adult behavior i logged on to uber corporate at  in the morning told them my life was fantastic i need one salad ingredient and i pieced the fuck out never to be heard from again because i told you i found that in my phone four months later i was mortified switched to lyft been using lyft ever since in my head that is printed out and its taped to the wall in the uber office it must be i feel like they use it for training purposes hey how you doing welcome to uber two weeks paid vacation break rooms over there come here tell us what the fuck you think it means croutons theres a large office prize no you laugh but i could have helped those wonky tooth little bastards i failed i live with that i feel bad about it okay because you have to when youre in a situation where you could help children you do it everyone knows thatthats a weird time to laugh weird its weird feel like do you want to just like well close our eyes you leave so we dont see you so we dont report thermometers you a couple weeks ago my young niece she didnt feel well and my sister took her temperature with a laser gun beep you seen the laser gun beep yeah you seen that yeah where was that technology in the  there was a planet full of children that could have used that technology in the  and i see young people in the audience and i dont even know if you know what im talking about i dont know if you know what we went through but when you sneezed or when you had the sniffles when i was little they had to get up your ass very quickly nobody talks about that i feel like it didnt need to happen no one talks about it lets talk about it now i dont know why the common cold in the  was so closely related to sodomy i dont know why my word to my mother that i didnt feel well wasnt good enough for herlike i said when you sneezed in  it got real weird real fast i used to sneeze in the closet for fear of retaliation seriously i was like you are never getting me i will eat an apple every day and i will sneeze amongst these coats for the younger people this is how it would go down when i was younger my mom would feel my forehead and be like he feels hot and then my dad would be like yeah but how hot hear me out why dont we stick this glass rod up his asshole and really get to the bottom of it at that point you are doing more damage than the cold the common cold goes away in  days forced penetration sticks aroundi feel like we needed one reasonable adult in the  that could have changed the course of history for us just one to be like you know what i felt his forehead he feels warm good enough for me i swear to you i felt like i had a gaggle of adults around me at all times like you need to penetrate this sick little boy now or well never know if he needs a cough drop now bend the boy over stick the mercury up his hole against his will or how will we know if he needs plenty of liquidsi know some of you are saying what about under the tongue no i was one of four okay i dont know who was reamed prior but you start with the hole you stick with the hole under the tongue is no longer an option its a glorious time for temperatures so soak it up really soak it up because one day my children are not going to know what i went through and i thought about it and i do not think that is fair so i will split the difference i will take their temperature using the laser gun but i will shove that up their fcking assand by the way lasers existed in the  the technology was there it didnt have to happen i realized that  years too late as i got older i realized so many things like that after the fact i used to live with my older grandparents as a kid and the main thing that i took away from living with old people all those years as a child is that i always thought that when i got older moths would be a much bigger issue my grandparents battled moths like their pensions were riding on it seriously there were so many mothballs piled in my grandfathers closet that i thought that when i got older moths might be a legitimate hurdle that i was supposed to overcome in my life at some point i thought they were to be feared i prepared for moths like a doomsday prepperif you would have asked me back then what do you want out of life sal i would have been like what do i want the same thing that you want go to school get a good education graduate go to college graduate from there get a good job with a good salary find a gal settle down have a couple kids everybodys healthy dont get overtaken by the mothshow much of a problem were moths that balls needed to be invented what was going on before the balls mayhem people roaming the streets glazed look on their face tattered clothing like dont go in there its a proper shit show and we dont yet have a solution hey dude i know you hate moths dont worry i invented balls cool bro those kill moths now no you just store them in your closet your closet will smell like piss and you wont want to go in it anymore what even do they do they dont kill moths they just smell like urinal cakes what kind of business model is that honestly at the end of the day whats worse someone being like oh my god sal you have a little hole in your lapel or lets make a run for it here comes the human golden shower just walk around smelling like piss give me the holesit also blows my mind that a moths food of choice is a shirt did you ever think about this they eat clothes and heres where it gets tricky for me moths were around before clothes so what did they eat then and how godawful was it that they were like give me slacks i know nothing of moths but there was one moth to be like yo bro i know youre chomping on that lard that you love but when youre done give me a shot i got something thats going to blow your balls off its called the poloi feared thermometers i feared moths thunder thunder debilitated me as a kid okay my mom when we had a bad storm my mom used to have to talk me down from the thunder and shed say honey dont worry about the thunder thats just god bowling youve heard that yeah youve heard that why are you applauding that why would you applaud that thats a sack of  lie right there why do we do that to children dont lie to me tell me the truth about thunder the truth isnt bad theres no need for a coverup just say its a cold front meeting a warm front boom boom you got some thunder there you tell me its god bowling i took that information to school i got my ass handed to me i walked into school that day like a confident meteorologist i was like you guys are scared of this thats just god and his goodtime pals tanya calm down thats just jesus engaging in light recreation you should be less concerned about the thunder and more concerned that hes up there taking a load off while you have crohnsim going to shoot my kid straight its the only way to go i think its a terrible thing to do to lie to them imagine explaining thunder to children in less fortunate areas or countries even like that like a third world country that would be insane honey i know youre scared right now were all scared this is the likes of a storm we have never seen and we are low on food and rations and medicines and the village is washing away and we havent seen your sister in quite some time but dont worry thats just god  bowling dont you dare trouble him with prayer right now hes a thunderbolt away from a turkeywhat is bowling honey bowling is the thing that the rich countries do where people wear shoes made of the hides of animals and they stand on polished wood and they throw a marble sphere down an alley to knock down ivory pins only to pick them right back up it doesnt sound real i know it is real honey god is whats not realoh i knew that would split the audience  however the joke is on you i am religious i say that to see where the pagans are i see you and i see you and i saw you so now i know no i was raised catholic i went to catholic school from kindergarten to senior year of college yes so i dont believe its not anything profound its just that if you believe in heaven you have to believe in hell thats the yinyang thats the rule they set up i dont want to believe in hell so i choose not to  god bowling we will say anything to kids we dont even care if it sounds believable in the least the tooth fairy the whole concept of the tooth fairy is cuckoo bananas it sounds like an acid trip you know when i found out about the tooth fairy the day i lost my first tooth not a year not a month they forgot to tell me i found out the day i lost it im six i have to process this information by nightfall i couldnt believe what i was hearing i was like dad lets just get this out of the way a woman is going to access the home this evening despite the locks to take a piece of my mouth and youre signing offmiddle of the night some noname hussy is going to saunter in here while im eyeballs deep in a rem cycle no name by the way no name thats not a red flag she only goes by her job title if i had someone walk up to me like hey im stan this is my wife regional manager id be suspect to stan and reggie right away i said dad why dont we put it in the mailbox clean transaction everybody wins he said she only flies here if its under the pillow i said she has wings i need to call jason jason was my best friend at the time i wanted to call him to warn him what would i even say jason listen theres not a lot of time a noname floozy is coming for your teeth tonight and the deadbolt dont mean i said dad we dont know this woman what if shes having a bad day she comes in here and starts taking other body parts like what if she got up on the wrong side of her cocoon and she comes in and just takes my kneecaps now i have no caps dad now i have no caps are they baby caps will i get these caps back dad how much will i get for these caps i had extensive questions about the capshe said shell give you a dollar i said a dollar why didnt you lead with that i was six it was  a dollar i felt like mark cuban i was like im going to buy a little league team with this money i would have gone to the playground like all your  is getting gum today i said you know lets try to go to sleep all right a dollar so that was the motivationi went to sleep fell asleep eventually and i woke up sometime in the middle of the night when i woke up i was frozen okay and i started to inch my hand up my body slowly as to not make a big fuss because i dont know what this woman is capable of and i reached around my neck and i felt paper and i pulled it out and it was a dollar and you would think from what i told you that i was happy i felt extremely violated i immediately went help shes in the housei heard my dads footsteps like he ran hes like whats the matter i go shes in the house she may still be in this house i said get my tooth back he couldnt calm me down hysterics he had to take me out of my bed at  in the morning he walked me down the hall to the kitchen and he showed me right on the kitchen counter was an envelope he opened it and my tooth was in it i believed in the tooth fairy for four hours he still couldnt calm me down and im like no im just crying im flailing hes like look at me stop hes like sal i just showed you the tooth youre okay i did that im the tooth fairy thats your tooth you dont have to worryyou got to understand something though i was six years old it was  am and i was dealing with a lot of trauma and i received that information not as there is no such thing as the tooth fairy i thought that he was telling me that my father was the fairy i went what do i call you now thats how confused i was i forgot about the fairy for a second and my main concern was how shall i address this man going forward everyone thinks theyre so progressive i was having the pronoun conversation  years ago thank you very muchi know now hes not the fairy hes one of our helpers  everything rattled me as a kid okay i was born in  and for most of the rhythm of  i was terrified that the rhythm was going to get me you could talk amongst yourselves you can explain it ill wait ill wait for you guys to just\\u2014if you dont know what im talking about there was a smash hit song in  called the rhythm is going to get you it was by gloria estefan and the miami sound machine its a very aggressive song my sister used to have the cassette tape and she used to play it over and over and overif you know the song if you dont know it if you havent heard it listen to it do me a favor as soon as you leave here tonight and i want you to listen to the lyrics because the lyrics are horrifying for a child this is how the song goes at night already scary when you turn off all the lights theres no place that you can hide the rhythm is going to get you the first time i heard that i was like yeah what the  did she just say im not preparedin bed throw the covers on your head and pretend like you are dead the  rhythms going to get you i dont know if she said  but she may as well have chicago i felt  no clue of whats happening to you but before this night is through oh baby the rhythm is going to get you thank you thank youall right and then the song continues as to taunt the child rhythm is going to get you rhythm is going to get you rhythm is going to get you the rhythm is going to get you im like when is this happening the songs like tonight im like yo tonight like in a little while sundown its the rhythm heretwo biggest things i was afraid of in  freddy krueger and the rhythm freddy krueger is a murdering child molester burnt head to toe to a crisp he has knives for fingers he comes back in your dreams to kill you and your loved ones you cant escape him i was afraid of that man and the rhythm i used to kiss my mom goodnight when i was little and for like six months in  id be like mom i love you i hope you sleep well also though might tonight be the night that the rhythm gets into the house and gets me specifically i give a  about my sister  that  she wants to play the tape over and over and summon the rhythm to our home i was like rhythm do me a favor you come to our house go down the hall make a hard right shes a toothless brunette underneath the hello kitty sheets with a death wish i want no part of thisagain my mom used to have to talk me down from it and she used to tell me honey dont worry about the rhythm its not coming for you its coming for all of us she doesnt do things the right way no no she was like honey dont worry about the rhythm its a phrase and when you get older you will understand but i promise you you are in no immediate danger and thats all i needed i trusted my mom that was fine put that to bed for me until the day that this woman used the rhythm against meme and my sister are fighting one day my moms like guys cut it out guys im not going to say it again and then she just went all right thats it and she turned in one motion and swiped the phone off the wall and she went hello the rhythms on the phone maybe dont laugh at that thats terrorism you know thats straightup domestic t i was a smartass when i was little and i was like how is the rhythm on the phone the phone didnt ringa couple of months later there we were fighting again and we were getting into it and my mom was like guys cut it out and she said guys dont make me say it again and then she went okay fine which i think is even scarier she walked to the wall like she had all the time in the world and she just picked up the phone and she looked at me and she dialed numbers and she waited and she went hello yes this is adele no he has not listened to me today at all yeah hes standing right here oh sure thank you so much and she puts the phone to me i took a deep breath released some urine i took a step toward the phone put it in my hand put it to my head my hand was trembling like this and i went hello who is this and the voice on the other line said this is the rhythmno that is very wrong you dont do that to a child my mother should be in jail straightup penitentiary for that woman you dont do that to a boy that affected me deeply how deeply it happened when i was  im  in chicago and were talking about itso i was a terrified kid i became a terrified adult i am terrified right now ill tell you about one of the most frightening things that happened to me in my adult life i used to live in this little studio basement apartment underneath like a townhouse and one day i was sleeping deep sleep all the lights pitch black and i heard a pounding at the door and you know you know you can tell when something is an emergency i heard like  and in one motion i left from a deep sleep to my feet and i was like hello my heart was beating out of my chest and i heard sal its dave open the doordave was my landlord hes the guy that lived upstairs from me at the time he was a big irish dude a new york city detective i stumbled in the dark to the door cracked it open just enough for the light to seep in i squinted whats updid you hear anything he asked urgentlyno i replied whats upyou didnt hear anything he pressedno whats going onhe explained i just got home my door upstairs is off the hinges somebody broke into my house and i think theyre still in there lets gohold on a second i pay you rent and now im drafted into this your tenant im a straightup civilian he didnt even wait for a response he walked away like i was automatically enlistedso i threw on my terry cloth bathrobe and house slippers\\u2014prime combat attire i suppose\\u2014and followed him to the front of the house sure enough i saw the door hanging precariously off the middle hinge it was chilling for a fleeting moment i thought oh we sure this isnt the tooth fairy i didnt want him to go in there and shoot my fatherwere standing there and in a moment of sheer intensity he reaches into his jacket pulls out a gun and cocks it now i know you guys are from here but im from there im not used to seeing a gun right in front of my face let alone cocked and ready with a serious face he says to me im going to go inside and secure the first floor you get my backand i said im your guy i dont know why i said that im not his guy im nobodys guy im barely a guyhe goes in methodically technically its like something out of a tv show hes sweeping the rooms moving with precision im standing there like an extra waiting for my cue head to toe in south park pajamas terry cloth bathrobe the only thing i can do is mimic him hed say kitchens clear and id echo my kitchens clear closets clear id follow with all clear in the closethe comes up to me and says ive canvassed the first floor were good down here now you and i have to go upstairs and for some reason i repeated still your guywe start ascending the steps and the tension is palpable hes stonefaced ready to act making not a single creek on the steps im right behind him mimicking every move head to toe in south park pajamas and terry cloth bathrobe i even felt compelled to do this  with my hand thinking maybe the robber would believe i had a weapon toowe reach the top of the steps three doors two are open\\u2014ones a half bath the others a spare bedroom one door is closed meaning if anyone is in the house theyre behind that door everything is going to happen right nowi know were laughing but i want you to appreciate the gravity try to put yourself in my slippers ive been awake for  seconds and now i could get shot dave starts doing hand signals intricate ones im like why would you believe that i can interpret this can we please go downstairs and whisper about itbefore i can communicate that i dont know what im supposed to do he kicks his own door open it flies back and he rushes in with his gun drawn a surge of adrenaline coursed through me i felt something come up my toes and out the top of my head and i involuntarily yelled pow powpow pow i made the sound of a gun from cartoons thats how i helped that man an onomatopoeia he didnt get shot but could you imagine if he had and the footage was on the news local  shot dead making gun sounds id be on camera yes i said pow pow there was nobody in theredave didnt turn around for ten seconds his back was shaking with silent laughter finally he turned and just said pow pow i was like dave i did all that i couldtwo weeks later he raised my rent by amsterdam\\u2014that was scary but it was nothing compared to the handsdown worst experience of my life the worst night of my life i was in amsterdam with my girlfriend on vacation a few years back we came out of the van gogh museum it was getting dark and we had no plans what are we going to do tonight we wondered by chance across the street was the amsterdam royal concert hall a beautiful old landmark venue the marquee read tonight only the amsterdam symphony orchestra with guest vocalist rufus wainwright id heard his name didnt know much about him but i knew he was some virtuoso look at this i said a specific night in amsterdam thats what were going to dowe ran across the street bought two tickets right before it started my girlfriend says

second my ass hits the velvet we need to leave nowlet me explain something to you guys this was handsdown the scariest worst experience of my entire life nothing was funny about it it was traumatic the only way i could explain how i felt was like i was having a million thoughts at once couldnt process any of it didnt understand what was real or not and felt like i was going crazy and drowning and suffocating in my own thoughtsi turned to her we need to leave nowwhybecause everybody in here is trying to kill mehuheverybody in here wants me deadshe starts laughing do you know how infuriating it is when you think  people are targeting you and the one person youre with is having a chuckle why are you laughingbecause its funnyits funny im telling you a courtesy in a couple of seconds im going to stand up scream at the top of my lungs and run away im telling you as a courtesy i kept saying that over and overyoure not going to do thatyes i am and ill tell you another thing a woman in a wheelchair has situated herself in the aisle we just came down shes blocking it and im not going to die if i have to get past her something may happen between me and herwhatits either her or meyoure not going to touch that womanyes i am ive already made peace with itat that moment the lights went down the symphony came out with rufus and they started the concert i was stuck there his voice was otherworldly angelic i immediately started crying hard my throat started to close up constrict get coarse and it started to hurt i couldnt swallow my tongue felt like sandpaperthey poisoned mewho do you think poisoned youthese peoplehow do you think they poisoned youthe hot winebabe i had the hot wineyoure nexti was processing real grief she said babe you probably have dry mouth why dont you go in your fanny pack and get yourself a ricola i carry them so i look down at my fanny pack which a moment ago was at my feet but now my fanny pack was probably  feet down im just staring at it for a minute like how am i supposed to get down there im only a man this is a  to  job with a ladderit took minutes but finally i had an idea i reached and threw my hand down watching my arm extend  feet it took  minutes i was watching the concert like this finally i got down there grasped it and now i had to come back up\\u2014double the time i got the fanny pack up here took out a ricola and its individually wrapped this posed another problem im holding it right here looking at it like how am i supposed to penetrate this militarygrade wrapper im dying i need this lemon lozengeafter minutes i decided you know what in order to unwrap it im going to have to unwrap it so i go to unwrap it and it sounds like this  i freaked out theres no way this came from my ricola wrapper i looked around no one was looking at me so i had to do it again because i was almost a goner i went to unwrap it again slowly  and i went everybody madmy girlfriend said whateverybody here madwhat are you talking about whyon account of my ricolai dont know what youre talking aboutin that moment from the stage rufus wainwright finished singing his first song its been about four minutes and he addressed the audience for the very first time with his nonsinging voice he goes like this hello amsterdam and i was like what is going on his singing voice didnt match his regular voice and i did not have the mental capacity or fortitude to understand that in that moment and i freaked outi turned to the old man next to me who had white hair and blue eyes and went is he gay he is gay hes a famous out gay man everybody in the theater knew that but me the old man knew it so he shot me a look like i was a lunatic it freaked me out am i gay i asked the old man if i was gayi know some of you are like you didnt ask him if you were gay yes i did i smoked hash i promise you chicago in that moment i did not know who was gay as i was asking him in my head i looked to the stage and rufus wainwright went ricola i turned to my girlfriend that must be a code word we have to leave nowits the first song im not leavingi will always love you excuse me excuse me excuse me i said getting to the aisle i saw that woman in the wheelchair and started running to her i knew i wasnt going to get past her so right before i magically pumped the brakes i went moveshe went huhi went huh and threw my ricola at her hitting her right off the left tit i burst through the doors of the theater outside hyperventilating  seconds later my girlfriend comes outtake me to the hospitalcalm downno i told you i was very unsettledtake

night with no safety net for better or for worse knowing that these days it could be risky to their careers its not easy its not easy to get up here and take really big swings at very touchy subjects and make it funny its a really important thing and i just want to give it up for those comedians that come on the stage every night and do that yeah for realbut im not that guy im more of a silly goose you know come to my show i tell you stories about my life we go outside i push you into the bushes we all go home but i do have controversial opinions i just never bring them to the stage but

like i dont know yeah you staying with your mom you in a safe spot people ask me weird questions so thats the only thing i dont like they ask this weird stuff like the other day somebody came up to me and was like i heard youre friends with jack harlow and i am hes a very great talented rapper hes a cool dude nice guy so were pals right and kanye put him on his new album even though ive been friends with him for like two three years you know he did it anyway people come up to me and theyre like how does that make you feel does that bother you does that get under your skin and im like no

we went to this knicks game yeah theyre the best and very hilarious that they hang out with me its really weird but im stoked because theyre heroes so were watching the game and its the game when steph curry breaks the threepoint record right and i remember he broke the threepoint record in the first quarter and just somehow how we were placed because he shot it from over there and me jon and chris were under the basket so like in the picture that everybody put out thats like heres him breaking the record us three are just like like we all look we completely photobombed his whatever basketball card thats going to be like forever and it was such a good night but its so weird because since then horrible things have happened to me and chris so jon stewart if youre watching watch your fucking back lucky bastard its like chris gets slapped i get decapitated then jon stewart wins the mark twain award so i havent been on stage much but ive been trying to make a joke about epsteins plane funny thats usually how it goes in any room that i ever pitch this joke on but i just like hear me out the guy obviously bad dude you got to get that out of the way bad dude shouldnt do that stuff but i didnt understand why people were mad at all the dudes that took a free plane ride like the jeffery epstein doc came out and this dude raped and did a bunch of terrible stuff to little young girls and then people would be like can you believe chris tucker rode on that plane its like yeah have you ever tried to fly commercial from fucking la to new york its a fucking nightmare because ive been in situations now let me rephrase that i know a dude who gives me free plane rides right i dont really know what he does he tells me hes in the waste management business thats what he says im in waste management im a garbageman i go yeah tons of garbagemen have private jets so but i just dont ask im just like okay whatever because i dont think theres anything wrong with taking the

dont think you can hear me are you ready for more show coming to the stage is a very dear friend of mine from new york city yall put your hands together for giulio gallarottione more time for neko guys let him hear ityeah sound about right yeah that sounds good good feeling good you know comedians travel a lot so we see a lot of crazy stuff i saw something on a plane the other day that i couldnt believe was on a plane just a guy with a falcon and it wasnt in a cage just on his arm and i was like how is that allowed on a plane you can just bring a falcon on a plane i cant bring four ounces of water on a plane but i can bring a falcon birds of prey no problem thats crazy i started thinking about it and im like the idea of a falcon having to fly in a plane the flight was only an hour the falcon can easily fly there on its own i was convinced that right before we actually got on the plane the guy was just going to be like alright dude see you there how is this allowed when i saw the falcon i was making a video i made sure i got the falcon in there with a cameo i was editing that video for two or three months and i was just looking at myself every day and i just started hating the way that i look specifically i was a little heavier too in the video my body i was just not that down  i dont gain weight in a masculine way when i gain weight it immediately just starts to be like i start to get all curvy i feel like as a guy you dont want your descriptive word to be voluptuous oh yeah gs thick dude its crazy its amazing like if you can see yourself on a video thats a great way to know that youve gained weight but otherwise how do you find out typically your rudest friend will tell you which is a crazy thing to be doing ill never forget the last time this happened to me i went to visit one of my friends and the person who told me id gained weight was the guy who mows his lawn hes a very nice guy but doesnt speak english at all but still he was able to convey to me that he thought id gained weight which ill never forget because i show up im like hey whats up he goes papi and i was in denial i was like maybe he just thinks i look strong or something i dont know how one could ever think that this means strong so i just said oh thank you papi and he made sure to clarify he goes no papi and to make sure there was no mistake in my brain he just starts going  im like dude youre a dick isnt that sad i dont know i cant imagine ever saying some shit like that to somebodys face i would at least wait for them to leave the room then id be like man he looks terrible i say bro a lot when i talk and then sometimes i get selfconscious that im going to get grouped in with a group of people that i feel like i shouldnt be associated with you know rambunctious young white men im like to the point to where i see a group of bros i actually get disgusted im like look at these fucking bros it can ruin my mood i went to dinner it was a sushi restaurant that i was really looking forward to going to eat at it was fancy i sit down they seat me next to these bros and im looking over there like look at these fucking bros theyre not even going to appreciate this meal theyre going to be ordering shit that isnt even on the menu can we get some sake bombs their dads are probably paying dude fuck this so i was like you know what im going to monitor them to make sure theyre being wellbehaved i dont know what power i have just to prove myself right and as it turns out these bros were wonderful gentlemen they were great guys i swear they were mildmannered and polite compassionate with the waitstaff they were engaging in thoughtprovoking conversation while maintaining their inside voices the entire time i was like these bros were raised right these bros are pros seriously it was as if these bros had achieved the next level of brodom which i didnt even know was possible you guys probably think that perhaps they werent bros at all but they were because they were still doing all the shit that bros do but just in a much more classy and sophisticated manner ill give you the best example a plate of sushi comes over one of the bros scoops up a piece perfect chopstick work and then he takes a bite and he just started really earnestly enjoying it and then he said the most bro thing you could ever say but in a much more classy and refined way so ill never forget hes like fire fire i said send some sake bombs over there on me dude this bros awesome guys thank you very much i really appreciate it aw it was super fun you guys ready for the next comedian if you make some noise ill bring her out make some noiseguys the next comedian coming to the stage shes amazing one of my best friends i love her please give it up for carly aquilinowow thank

anytime they tell me theres a new variant im like okay i got the vaccines when i still wasnt sure about the vaccines like i trusted the vaccines blindly my friends were like i trust science im like i dont know science at all im sorry never learned it dont know anything about it im kind of dealing with the vaccine the way i deal with men in my life im like ill do this but i wont be surprised if i end up regretting it i miss a lot of things about the lockdown is that bad to say  no no i took seven walks a day i miss those videos that went viral every single day of just a woman that didnt want to wear her mask i love that lady i love them it was always the same thing too it was just some lady like you cant tell me im sorry that shes southern its just that she was always southern you cant tell me what to do and the other person was just like maam this is a long john silvers and youre not wearing any shoes i i went through a lot kind of during the lockdown im  now but i turned  during the whole thing thank you wow are you guys all  like every single one of you thats cool i went through this thing though where i thought about where i would be at this point in my life like what i would have thought as a teenager do you ever do that it messes me up like if you would have asked me at  years old i would be like um okay first of all heres the stuff thats going to happen  ew thats disgusting but so im definitely going to get married when im  for sure thats happening and then im just going to go to europe for five years because that doesnt cost any money thats free and then by the time im  im going to have three kids just be a stayathome mom and now im  and im always like do i have two tampons in right now i dont even know i dont even know where they go honestly i i have no way i lose them constantly i have no idea where they are thats my biggest fear as a grown woman can you imagine by the way that happened to me and i dont want to talk about it but ill tell you guys everything so i went to go to the bathroom and i pull my pants down and i look down and i saw two strings and i was like  am i a ceiling fan why why exactly are there two strings coming out of my body right now i dont know if you guys know this anything more than one string is classified as an emergency thats bad its a bad vibe i had to go to the doctor my poor gyno this poor woman i feel so bad for her she hates me i know that she does im always going to her with problems that i make up like i always think im pregnant every single month i think im pregnant even if i dont have sex im like mm i dont know happened to mary it could definitely happen to me the last time i went in to her for that she said let me ask you a question the person that you were with did he withdraw took me a second definitely took me a second to realize what she said and then when i figured it out i was like that was so classy honestly i felt like a princess i was like this was really nice for me thank you so much i had never heard it said that way withdraw i was like girl he deposits hes making a lot of transactions and its bad i also went through a breakup during the pandemic which was kind of crazy you know its bad when in the middle of a lockdown somebody looks at you and theyre like hey we should see other people i was like thats illegal but i get it you know so now im dating again and its hard you cant do it how am i supposed to go out and meet people when i was young i would worry i would worry so much when i went out with a guy i would be like is he going to kill me and now i would prefer it like i im done no im done thank you im all set ive seen enough im done ive realized that i have very bad judgment when it comes to men i was at a bar and i see this guy at the other end of the bar and im with my friends and he had four tattoos on his face and i saw it and i was like im going to fix it whatever it is i will fix that and my friends were like i think hes in a gang i was like i think youre jealous of me like im sorry i have a boyfriend you dont like girl if you cant find a man just say that and thats really how i feel im sorry but its a lot of jealousy but i feel like we dont see the red flags we want to see the good in people i always make up excuses for guys ill go out on date my friends will be like hey how was your first date im like um  well he made me cry and hes definitely a liar and i think hes married and i think he stole  dollars out of my bag but theres just something about him i really do i feel good about thisthank you guys so much youre such a fun crowd are you ready to keep this show going i want you to give a warm welcome to such a funny guy dave sirusalright how you guys doing everything went great great well my names dave ill be your jew for the evening but honestly thank you all so much for being here it is so amazing for me to see all you to be here to see that my friendship with pete is finally paying off yeah im jewish im also russian so thats fun now yeah im a russian jew so you know what that means im two kinds of untrustworthy but honestly though i feel like even if russia had never done anything people still wouldnt trust us just for the accent because like when you have a russian accent you kind of always sound like youre about to lie about something its just taking you a second to figure it out like the first time i talked to my landlord he was like  oh you should rent this apartment uh you wont be sorry oh you should meet my daughter she is  beautiful  so i should tell you guys a little bit about myself ive always been creepy that wasnt the joke i no like honestly ever since i was a kid i was just always a really weird kid but like i didnt know how weird everyone else thought i was i think that happens with weird kids i didnt even realize how crazy of a thought it was until i grew up and if i was going through something my dad would be like listen were just proud of you for not being a serial killer like wait what did i do so the first clue i ever had about how weird everyone else thought i was was in the seventh grade my parents got this letter from the school board that said congratulations david has been selected for a very special program called life skills and i was so dumb i thought this proved i was gifted so i go to this weeklong program thats in a building far away from my normal school i open the door and this is exactly what happened i see there are two eager grad students and the nine most fuckedup kids in my school i mean the kids who were caught smoking drinking fucking fighting the girls who got pregnant the guy who got them all pregnant and me even though like unlike these other kids i hadnt really gotten in trouble my grades were fine i was and would stay a virgin for eight more years yet i was in this class with the dangerous kids and its only now as an adult do i finally realize what was going on that i was the scariest kid in my school because all the other kids in this class knew what they did to be put into this class they were all there for a very specific onpaper reason but with me it was just a feeling that the whole faculty agreed on to separate me now so that same year i had this one teacher mr marigan he was my favorite teacher and heres the thing i was really weird i didnt have any friends i loved attention which is why this is happening so i really needed someone to talk to if youre a weird kid you find someone your family a teacher for me that was the cool science teacher i had mr marigan because even if i was having a bad day i could still tell him a couple of jokes in class when i walked in that i knew hed appreciate more than these dumb kids so id be like hey mr marigan i read in this book that i can talk to dead people if i have a pint of goats blood a human thumb and a paper plate do you have any plates yeah exactly kid jokes ten years later my little brother became best friends with mr marigans son this is really what he said to my brother he goes oh wow youre davids brother that kid scared the shit out of me yeah the talk to dead people kid is he in jail and i said to my brother no way no way i know mr marigan loved me i was like his favorite student and i have proof because that year my mom had made a deal with me i could only go to camp if my worst grade for the year was a b or better and i knew i wasnt going to go because i actually got a really bad grade on marigans final i was going to get more like a d and then last day of school i got my report card and i was i swear to god shocked because i got my b and i knew i didnt deserve it i figured he knows how hard im working and how much i wanted it im a good student he gave me some extra points whatever it was i just knew he hooked me up for some reason and that meant a lot to me that was why mr marigan was my favorite teacher for years after that until i got to hear the other half of that story this is really what he said to my brother he goes look im going to tell you how much that kid freaked me out i dont know how he did it i dont know how he figured out how to do it but somehow some way when i was doing his grade point average at the end of the year it equaled out to a perfect  i was so scared i gave him a b yeah turns out marigan did not understand me at all but it did get me into camp which by the way was a terrible experience i wish i hadnt gone to honestly i think the reason i was so weird part of it is that my mom had me really young she was  i love my mom but she wasnt ready for how weird i would be heres a perfect example so the next year i was probably  and like i said i was really unpopular no friends and i was desperate for a girlfriend i wanted a girlfriend so bad and i wasnt even horny i was fantasizing about someday getting to buy a girl a locket like thats how wholesome i was so i knew i could never date a girl at my own school so i had a plan if i could just meet girls in other school districts it could take weeks for them to find out about me so i got a bunch of art supplies that i had in my basement because i was actually really into drawing at the time i actually went to college to be a painter thats why i do comedy for a living so i got these art supplies and i really did this im not even joking i really made a bunch of handdrawn homemade posters that really did say childrens dating service oh and my phone number and my mom walked in on me making these posters and i swear to god she said oh good idea want me to help you put these up that is poor parenting i am convinced to this day that the only reason i wasnt molested is that every pervert in my town thought that this was the laziest police sting theyd ever seenthanks a lot guys im dave weve got weve got such a great show for you this next comic he is one of my favorite comics in the world you may have seen him in the movie big time adolescence lets give a big hand everybody for joey gaywhats up fuckers how are you oh no thats not going to work how are you  thats right it was fine its great to be here my name is joey gay gay i grew up in brooklyn that shit was not cool other children beat the shit out of me because my last name is gay two weeks ago i found out my last name is from the champagne region in france i know it got gayer which seems weird in this late stage in the game and its supposed to be pronounced ghee right but i still live in brooklyn i dont have the time or the balls to correct people like oh no sir thats pronounced ghee people in brooklyn are dickheads theyll be like oh i know i got a cousin whos ghee he sucks cooks so happy to be here tonight i had a heart attack recently they wheeled me into the hospital the doctor came out and the first thing he said to me was sir we found drugs in your system i was like ah doctor i put the drugs in my system lets move on to the heart attack thats the part i dont know about he wanted to be a dick he wanted to keep going hes like about the drugs i was like fuck this guy im going to flip it on him i was like yeah about the drugs i want them back they had to prepare me for surgery that was scary while they prepared me for surgery they shaved down here but only half only the right half the top and one of the twins the lowhanging one yeah and then they started surgery by going in through my wrist yes i was like hey what the fuck he was like well in case this doesnt work well go in i was like couldnt you have waited look at this do you know what its like to be laying naked on the edge of death surrounded by strangers thinking god let me live so i can shave this other nut dont send me to the afterlife looking like this lord having a heart attack is a fuckedup thing after that youve got to change stuff you got to change stuff i had to start exercising i had to give up cigarettes oh my god do i miss cigarettes cigarettes are the single greatest vice on the planet if you dont believe me allow me to explain people used to go home at night to smoke and they would put on their smoking jacket it is a vice that is so good it had apparel you would go into your home and put on a silk jacket like some sort of tobacco pimp i wish other vices had apparel too right so then when you showed up at the bar on friday night and you saw your friends you would know exactly what type of bullshit you were in for that night people would be like hey theres larry you would be like dont wave at larry why not larry is wearing his crack helmet larry is going to be an asshole tonight borrowing money chewing on his face im getting older and finding out in weird fucking ways i found out i was getting old at my bodega last year when they gave me my change they were like thank you my dude now they go thank you sir hey fuck you ease off on that sir shit whenever some young motherfucker gives me that sir shit i have something for them though when they go thank you sir i go i welcome your thanks young squire see that puts an end to that sir shit  of the time but the asshole at my bodega on the corner likes to spend his weekends at the renaissance festival yeah so now every time i come in hes like my liege i like los angeles its crazy though i was out here on hollywood boulevard it reminds me of my hometown new york listen if you are from new york or la you have a superpower that other people in the country dont and that is you can ignore more crazy than anybody else on the planet you could be standing on a corner waiting for the light to change a stranger could walk up next to you he could be
